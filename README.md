# Machine-Learning
This repository contains the code and the content for Machine Learning Algorithms.
The supervised Learning notebook contains the Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms
1) Naive Bayes: The first algorithm is the Naive Bayes Classifier
     * The implementation is done on the Titanic Dataset.
     * It is directly imported from the Seaborn.
     * THe notebook also includes the preprocessing that was necessary for the model implementation
     * In the Naive Bayes section, a brief introduction to the concept Predict_proba() method is also discussed.
     * Predict Probabilities enables us to understand the probabilities of the data belonging to the different classes.
